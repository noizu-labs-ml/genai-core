GenAI Core Library
====

GenAI Core contains base protocols used by GenAI to simplify the process of 
merging in new features and functionality from
the genai_core_vnext repo. 

The intent of the core library is to isolate out core functionality to make 
extensibility more straight forward and to
isolate the exllama support as an add to make using with livebook more straight 
forward.
